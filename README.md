# Welcome To CounterSpace.

This is the Rails back-end for Counterspace, my final project for the Flatiron School's software engineering program. It is not a "real" website -- the kitchens and users are randomly seeded, and not based on real people or places.

The repository for the front-end can be found here: https://github.com/stopvoldemort/counterspace.

## Description

Love to cook for a large group, but don't have the space in your apartment? This web application allows you to rent large, well-stocked kitchens and beautiful dining rooms from others who have more space than they are using.

Guests are able to search for kitchens by location, book reservations, message their host, and leave reviews. Kitchen owners are able to easily manage their reservations and message with their guests.

## Technologies

* Ruby on Rails
